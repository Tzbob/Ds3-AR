This project is a continuation of all the amazing work done by [Pireax](https://github.com/Pireax) and [Monrandria](https://www.reddit.com/user/monrandria) in their [Google Sheets AR calculator](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4j3o40/spreadsheet_with_full_ar_calculation/).

In its current state ```ds3ar.ir``` is a direct port of the Sheets calculator.

Stay tuned for more!
